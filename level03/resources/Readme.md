### Level03 Write-up

## Level overview
**Category:** Binary Exploitation / Privilege Escalation

**Description:** Exploit a setuid binary that uses an insecure system call to escalate privileges and retrieve the flag for the next level.
## Analysis

Upon entering this level we find a 32-bit executable named level03 owned by the user `flag03` and the setuid/setgid bits set `-rws` `r-s`, which allows us to  execute it with the same privilage as the `flag03` user .

Running the program a message gets printed "Exploit me". Challenge accepted.

Let's see the function calls made by this program using `ltrace` 

![alt text](/level03/resources/images/image-2.png)

Looking through the output of `ltrace` we see that the program some instructions : 

- The program calls `geteuid()` to get the effective user ID, then uses `setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid())` and `setregid(geteuid(), geteuid())` to set both the real and effective UIDs/GIDs to the effective UID. This ensures the program runs with flag03 privileges.

>When a binary is setuid, only the effective UID changes to the owner (e.g. flag03), while the real UID stays the same as the user who executed it.

>The problem is that some library calls and shells (like the one spawned by system()) check the real UID and may drop privileges or restrict behavior if real UID â‰  effective UID.
>To avoid this, the program calls:
>setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
>setregid(getegid(), getegid());
>This makes the real UID/GID match the effective UID/GID, so the process runs fully as flag03 with no mismatch. Then system("/bin/sh") (or similar) gives a proper privileged shell.

- execute `/usr/bin/env echo` using `system` syscall

The vulnerability lies in the use `/usr/bin/env` before `echo` instead of (`/bin/echo`) u are forcing the `env` command to search for executables in the `PATH` variable in your environment, creating an opportunity for PATH injection.


## Cracking Process

Till now we that the `echo` command is being search in the `PATH` variable to exploit this we can :
- Create our own directory `/tmp/level03`
- Write a simple c program that executes the `getflag` command and named the executable `echo`
- Add the new directory to `PATH` environment variable.


**Exploitation Code** :

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

  system("getflag"); 

  return 0;
}
````

**Exploitation Steps** :

![](/level03/resources/image.png)

and we got the password for the next level: **qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus**

## Conclusion
This level demonstrates a fundamental security principle: **never trust user-controlled environment variables in privileged programs**

This vulnerability could have been prevented by:
- Using absolute paths: system("/bin/echo") instead of system("/usr/bin/env echo")
- Using execve() with a controlled environment instead of system()
